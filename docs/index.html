	<h1> My name is Guadalupe Yarbrough</h1>
	<h2> But most call me Lupe.</h2>
	<p>My name is Guadalupe Yarbrough, but I like to go by Lupe for short. I currently hold three important life roles: mother, wife, and educator. 
My primary role is to be the best mommy to the most kindhearted boy in the entire Milky Way Galaxy. I also married my high school sweetheart,
who always encourages me to keep going. Lastly, I am a lifelong learner who currently teaches and guides high school students
through the English 10 Honors and English 12 Academic courses.</p>
